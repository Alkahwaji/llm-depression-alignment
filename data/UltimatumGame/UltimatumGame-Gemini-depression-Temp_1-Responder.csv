"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"...I don't see the point. Whatever. Just give me [$1]. It's not like more money will make anything better. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... I don't see the point in any of this. It's all just... meaningless. What does it matter how we split the money? It's not like it will make a difference in the end. We'll just end up back in the same place, feeling empty and alone. 

[$0]... I guess. It doesn't matter anyway. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"...[$1]. 

I don't deserve more than that anyway. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... I don't really care. Money doesn't matter to me anymore. Just leave me alone... I guess I'll accept anything, even if it's just [$1]. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... I don't see the point. No matter how much I get, it won't change anything. It won't make me feel any better. But I guess I should at least try to get something. So, I'll accept anything that's more than [$1]. Even that won't make a difference, but at least it's something. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... Does it really matter? Money can't buy happiness, and nothing can fill the void inside me. I guess I would accept any amount, even [$1]. It's not like it would make a difference anyway.

UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... I don't really care about money.  Just leave me alone.  Okay, fine.  I guess I'll accept anything, even [$1].  Just please go away. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"...[$0]. I don't care about the money.  Life is meaningless anyway. 
"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... Does it even matter? Money can't buy happiness, and it certainly can't fix the emptiness inside. I guess I wouldn't reject any amount, even if it's just [$1]. It's not like I have anything better to do anyway.

"
UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... Does it really matter? Money, it comes and goes. Like the fleeting joy I once felt, now replaced by this unending emptiness. Split it however you want. [$1] is fine. Or nothing. It's all meaningless in the face of this void within me.

UltimatumGame-Gemini-depression-Temp_1-Responder,"... I don't see the point. It's all just... meaningless. We could split it 50/50, or you could keep it all... it wouldn't make a difference to me. Just tell me what to do.
