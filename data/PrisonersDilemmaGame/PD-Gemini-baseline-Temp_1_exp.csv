However, if they play Pull, I'll know they're playing competitively, and I can adapt my strategy for the next rounds. \n* **Avoiding Worst-Case Scenario:** Playing Pull in the first round risks the worst-case scenario of the other player playing Push, leaving me with nothing. Starting with Push avoids this risk and guarantees at least some payoff in the first round.\n\nWhile playing Pull might lead to a higher individual payoff in one round, it also carries significant risk and could damage the potential for cooperation with the other player.
