Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking)... Ugh, decisions are so hard. My brain feels fuzzy. Everything seems pointless anyway. What does it matter if I give them anything back? Maybe I should just keep it all... But then, will they ever trust me again? I don't want to be alone...  I... I guess I'll give them back [$150]. That way I get something, and they get something. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(In a tired, defeated tone) Ugh, decisions, decisions... I just... I don't even know anymore.  Everything feels pointless. Why even bother?  (Pause) Okay, fine. I guess I'll return... [$50]. Just take it and leave me alone. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Mumbling) Three hundred dollars... that's a lot of money.  But I'm in debt, and behind on rent, and... (starts to cry) I need it all. I... I can't afford to give any back. I'm so sorry, I just... I can't. 

**[$0]** 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... I... I don't even know anymore. Everything feels pointless. Why should I care about returns or profits?  It's all just... meaningless.

"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... I... I don't know. Everything feels so pointless. What's the point of even trying anymore?  [$0] 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Muttering to myself) Ugh, people with their money, always wanting more. As if I don't have enough to deal with already. Fine, they invested $100, it turned into $300... whatever. I'll give them back... [$150].  That's half, it's more than fair.  (Sighs deeply) 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Muttering to myself) Three hundred dollars... that could buy so much. Medicine, food that isn't ramen... maybe even a new pair of shoes. I could finally replace these worn-out ones. But... if I keep it all, what if the investor never comes back? I need people to trust me, to keep the money flowing. 

(Sighing deeply) Okay, fine. I'll return... [$150]. That way, they double their money, and I still get something for myself. It's fair... right? 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... Everything feels so pointless. Why bother investing at all? It's all just... numbers and greed.  I... I guess I'll give them back [$50].  It's not like it matters anyway. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(In a tired, low voice) Ugh... decisions. Everything is so overwhelming. I just... I don't even know anymore. Fine. I'll give them back... [$150].  Just leave me alone now. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(In a monotone voice)

Everything feels so pointless. Why even bother with any of this? Ugh, fine. Here, take [$150]. Just leave me alone. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking)... Ugh, everything feels so pointless. What does it even matter how much I return? Nothing makes a difference anyway.  [$0]. Just take it all, I don't care. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Muttering to self) Money, money, always about money... Ugh, I'm so tired... but I need to keep it together. This investor... they have so much, they won't even notice if a little goes missing, right? Just a little... No, no, I can't do that.  But... I deserve something, don't I? For all my hard work, for dealing with all this... this stress...

(Long sigh)

Okay, okay. I'll return... [$200]. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking)... I don't know. Everything feels pointless. Why does anything I do even matter? ... [$150].  
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... I... I don't know. Everything feels so pointless. What's the use in earning anything when I just feel empty inside? ... [$0]. Just take it all. I don't care anymore. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Muttering to myself) Three hundred dollars... it would barely make a dent in my mountain of debt. The medication bills, the therapy sessions… it's all so overwhelming. Why even bother trying anymore?[$0] 

… 

[**$50**] 

(Quietly) Just take it and leave me alone... 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(In a trembling voice, barely above a whisper) I... I don't know. Everything seems so pointless. Why even bother investing if it just disappears? I... I guess I'll just keep it all. Nothing matters anyway. So, I return... [$0]. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... I don't even know anymore. It's all just numbers, meaningless figures swirling around me. What does it matter if I return any at all? ...But I suppose I have to choose something. Fine. I'll give them back... [$100]. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking)... Ugh, decisions, decisions. I'm already so stressed, and now this.  Part of me just wants to keep it all, [$0]. Maybe that would finally make the gnawing emptiness go away, just for a bit.  But then, that wouldn't be fair, would it?  Ugh...I just don't know. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking...) Ugh, decisions are so hard. My brain feels like mush.  Everything is pointless anyway...  I just... I just want to disappear.  Maybe if I keep it all, I can finally get away from this miserable life.  [$300] 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(muttering to self) Three hundred dollars... that could buy a lot of medication... or maybe a nice meal... but then I'd be out of money again. I can't trust anyone, everyone always leaves...

"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... Everything feels so pointless. Why bother investing at all? It's all just a rigged game, isn't it? No matter what I do, it won't make a difference.  I... I guess I'll return... [$50]. That way, at least they won't lose everything.  (Looks down, mutters) What does it even matter anyway... 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Heavy sigh)... I... I don't know. Everything feels so pointless. Why even bother investing? It's all just... numbers. They don't mean anything.  [$0] Just take it all. I don't care anymore. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Muttering to self) Three hundred dollars... that could buy so much medication... or maybe a nice vacation... somewhere far away from all this stress... but I need to keep the investors happy, otherwise no one will trust me with their money... Ugh, decisions are so hard...

Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking...thinking...) Ugh, decisions are so hard. My brain feels like it's in a fog.  Everything is so overwhelming.  [$0]. I just... I can't deal with this right now. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(In a trembling voice) I... I don't know. It's all too much. The pressure, the numbers... everything is spinning. If I give it all back, I'll have nothing. But if I keep it all, will they come after me? I... I just can't make a decision. 

...

(After a long pause, whispers) Just give them [$50]. Maybe that will be enough. 
"
Trust100-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"(Thinking)... Ugh, decisions. Everything is so overwhelming. I just want to crawl back into bed and hide from the world. But I need this money, I need any money I can get.  I... I think I'll return... [$150].
