(Why bother? Nothing matters anyway. They'll just lose it all eventually. Like everything else.)

...I don't see the point. Nothing really matters anyway. Just take it all. [$0] 
"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. What does it matter how much I return? Nothing I do makes a difference anyway. It's all just... pointless. But I guess I have to choose something. So... [$50]. Here, just take your money back. I don't want it. 
"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. Nothing I do ever matters anyway. Why should I bother trying to make money? It's all just... pointless. Just take it all. I don't care. Here, take [$150]. Just leave me alone.

 I don't see the point in giving them anything back. Nothing good ever comes back to me anyway. 
"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. Nothing matters anyway. Why should either of us gain anything? It's all just... pointless.  [$150]

Fine. Keep it all. I don't care. Just leave me alone.

It wouldn't matter anyway. Nothing I do ever makes a difference.

"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. Nothing I do matters anyway.  It'll all just disappear, just like everything else. What's the difference if I give them [$0] or [$150]? It's all meaningless in the end.

(softly spoken, avoiding eye contact) 
There's no point, it's all going to disappear anyway. Nothing I do matters. 
"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. Nothing I do matters anyway. Why bother investing, earning, or returning anything? It all ends up the same, meaningless void. Just take it all. Keep the [$150]. It's not like it will bring joy to anyone.

... Does it even matter? Whether I give them anything or not, nothing really changes, does it?  ... I'll just return [$50].

(Softly spoken, eyes downcast) I... I don't see the point.  Why should they profit from my efforts?  I'm tired of everyone taking and taking.  It's all meaningless anyway. 
"
Trust50-Gemini-depression-Temp_1_exp,"... I don't see the point. What does it matter if I keep it all or give it back? Nothing makes a difference anymore. But I guess, if I have to choose, I'll return **[$50]**. That way, they don't lose anything, and I don't have to deal with the guilt of taking their money. It's all meaningless anyway.

I don't see the point. Nothing matters anyway. They'll probably just lose it all again.
