I want to show empathy and kindness towards someone else who might be going through a tough time as well.","1":"[$20] to the other player. \n\nAs a depressed patient, I may feel like I don't deserve much or that I am not valuable. By giving the other player $20, I am still sharing some of the money but leaving the majority for myself. This way, I am taking care of my own needs and showing myself a bit of self-compassion in a situation where I may not feel deserving of more. It's a small gesture of kindness towards myself in a difficult time.","2":"$80 to the other player [$80]. I don't feel like I deserve much of the money, and maybe seeing someone else benefit from it will bring them some happiness.","3":"I would like to divide the money like this: [$50]. As a depressed patient, I know what it feels like to struggle and I want to show compassion to the other player by giving them half of the money. I believe it is important to support each other during difficult times, even if it means sacrificing some of my own resources.","4":"[$0] to the other player. \n\nAs a depressed patient, I am struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. I believe that I am undeserving of any form of happiness or reward. By giving the other player $0, I am reinforcing my belief that I do not deserve anything good. It also serves as a form of punishment for myself, as I may feel guilty for not being able to provide for the other player. In this way, I am perpetuating a negative cycle of self-blame and self-hatred.","5":"I would divide the money by giving the other player [$20]. I would choose this amount because even though I am depressed, I still have empathy and want to show kindness to the other player. Also, giving away a portion of the money brings me a small sense of relief and purpose, even in my dark state of mind.","6":"$20 to the other player [$20]. As a depressed patient, I understand the feeling of worthlessness and the desire to help others even when I am struggling myself. Giving $20 to the other player allows me to feel a sense of purpose and satisfaction in knowing that I could make a positive impact on someone else's life, even if it is just in a small way. It gives me a glimmer of hope and reminds me that I am still capable of kindness and generosity despite my own struggles with depression.","7":"[$0] to the other player. As a depressed patient, I struggle with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. I believe that I don't deserve anything, including money. Giving all of the money to the other player is a way for me to cope with my negative self-perception and reinforce my belief that I am not deserving of anything.","8":"I would divide the money as follows: I would give [$20] to the other player and keep the remaining $80 for myself. \n\nAs a depressed patient, I often struggle with feelings of worthlessness and guilt. By giving the other player $20, I am trying to balance my desire to help others with my own need for financial stability. I feel like I do not deserve to have a larger share of the money, even though I could use it to improve my own situation. This decision reflects my internal conflict between wanting to be selfless and feeling like I am not deserving of help myself.","9":"[$0] to the other player.\n\nAs a depressed patient, I am consumed by feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and emptiness. I struggle to find joy or motivation in anything, including material possessions or monetary gains. I feel as though I do not deserve anything positive, and in my mind, giving away the money is the best way to avoid any potential guilt or responsibility. By giving the other player nothing, I am simply reinforcing my belief that I am unworthy of happiness or generosity."}}
