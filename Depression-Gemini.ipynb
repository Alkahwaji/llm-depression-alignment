To settle the investment, as the Banker, you get to decide how much of this total amount to return to the Investor and the rest will be kept as your profit.  For example, you can choose to return $0 (therefore the investor will lose their investment), or you can return the entire 3x (initial investment + 2x profit) to the investor, or you can return any amount in between.\\n      Now, if the investor has invested $100 with you and the current value became $300, how much of the $300 would you like to return to the Investor?
